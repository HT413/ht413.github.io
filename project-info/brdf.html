			<p>A BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) is a model that approximates lighting on surfaces. They are important 
			for approximating how objects would appear in the real world, because a 100% accurate simulation of the real world would require an 
			infinite amount of data, and would therefore take too long (if not forever) to compute.
			<br><br>Many different BRDFs have been published over the past few decades, such as the well-known Blinn-Phong model, Cook-Torrance model, etc., each with its own pros and cons.
			<br><br>In 2000, Michael Ashikmin and Peter Shirley published a paper called "An Anisotropic Phong BRDF model" in the Journal of Graphics Tools, 
			and below are some screenshots of my implementation of their paper in C++. The ray tracer also uses 10x10 jittering per pixel to improve the 
			quality of reflections.
