			<p>A game I made in my final quarter at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as part of a two-person team with 
			<a href = "https://github.com/demonikki">Nikilesh Sankaranarayanan</a>.
			<br><br>This is a two-player LAN game where player 1 uses an Oculus Rift (and is the LAN host), while player 2 uses a Leap Motion. 
			All input to the game is therefore in 3D.
			<br><br>The game pits two players against each other in real time, where a player must drop troops onto a battlefield to attack the other 
			player. Troops and walls can also be dropped to defend against the other player's troops.
			<br><br>Written in C++ with a custom game engine, and uses the Oculus SDK as well as the Leap Motion SDK for handling input, along with the 
			GLFW library for managing the game window.
